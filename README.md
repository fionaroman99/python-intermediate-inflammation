# Inflam
![Continuous Integration build in GitHub Actions](https://github.com/fionaroman99/python-interm

Inflam is a data management system written in Python that manages trial data used in clinical inflammation studies.

## Main features
Here are some key features of Inflam:
- Provide basic statistical analyses over clinical trial data
- Ability to work on trial data in Comma-Separated Value (CSV) format
- Generate plots of trial data
- Analytical functions and views can be easily extended based on its Model-View-Controller architecture

## Prerequisites
Inflam requires the following Python packages:

This repository is intended to be used as a code template which is copied by learners at [Intermediate Research Software Development Skills In Python](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-development) course.

This software project is not finished, does not contain a LICENCE file, the code is currently failing to run and contains some code style issues. 
It is used as a starting point for the course - issues will be fixed and code will be added in a number of places during the course by learners in their own copies of the repository, as course topics are introduced.

- [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/) - makes use of NumPy's statistical functions
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) - uses Matplotlib to generate statistical plots

The following optional packages are required to run Inflam's unit tests:

- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) - Inflam's unit tests are written using pytest
- [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) - Adds test coverage stats to unit testing

this README file is not complete, more information is still needed. Specifically, it needs info about:
installation, basic usage, contributing, contact information, credits, citation and licence.
